Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:


### Stage 1/4: Print first lines of code
  First, let's try to get some simple output from your code.

### Stage 2/4: Print an image of the animal
  Show the zookeeper an image of her ward.
### Stage 3/4: Show where animals live
  The zookeeper wants to know what is inside each habitat, by its number.
