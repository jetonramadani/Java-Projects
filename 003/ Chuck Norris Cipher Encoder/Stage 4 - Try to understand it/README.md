# Stage 4/5 - Try to understand it

## Description
In this stage, you will write a decoder for a cipher. You need to transform the encrypted message into its original format.

## Objectives
Your program receives a string of zeros and spaces and converts it to readable text. You must parse the string to the blocks of zeroes and decode the message the same way as in previous stages but in reversed order.

For example, your program receives `0 0 00 0000 0 000 00 0000 0 00`. You can split blocks of zeros and group those blocks by two. Then you need to decode these blocks like in the previous stage:

- `0 0` is `1`
- `00 0000` is `0000`
- `0 000` is `111`
- `00 0000` is `0000`
- `0 00` is `11`
Concatenation of the lines above gives us `10000111000011`.

After that, you need to split the result into blocks of seven symbols (binary form) and convert these blocks to characters. In this case, splitting `10000111000011` by seven symbols gives us two characters â€” `1000011` `1000011` , convert them into characters and the result will be `CC` (`C` is `1000011`).

In this stage, your program should:

1. Read a string from a console. The input contains a single line of spaces and `0` characters.
2. Print `The result:` line, followed by a line with a decoded message.

The `Integer.parseInt()` method might be useful at this stage.

## Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input encoded string:
> 0 0 00 0000 0 000 00 0000 0 00

The result:
CC
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input encoded string:
> 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 000 0 00 00 0 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0 00 000000 0 0000 00 000 0 00 00 00 0 00

The result:
Hi <3
```
