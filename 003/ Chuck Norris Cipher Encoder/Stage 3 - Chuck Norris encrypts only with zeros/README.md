# Stage 3 - Chuck Norris encrypts only with zeros

## Description
Binary with `0` and `1` is good, but binary with only `0` is even better! This encoding has a name — the Chuck Norris Unary Code.

Let's convert our text into a sequence of zeros and spaces!

## Objectives
The encoding principle is simple. The input message consists of ASCII characters (7-bit). You need to transform the text into the sequence of `0` and `1` and use the Chuck Norris technique. The encoded output message consists of blocks of `0`. A block is separated from another block by a space.

Two consecutive blocks are used to produce a series of the same value bits (only `1` or `0` values):

- First block: it is always `0` or `00`. If it is `0`, then the series contains `1`, if not, it contains `0`
- Second block: the number of `0` in this block is the number of bits in the series

Let's take a simple example with a message which consists of only one character `C`. The `C` symbol in binary is represented as `1000011`, so with Chuck Norris technique this gives:

- `0 0` (the first series consists of only a single `1`);
- `00 0000` (the second series consists of four `0`);
- `0 00` (the third consists of two `1`)
- So `C` is coded as: `0 0 00 0000 0 00`

Make sure, that an encoding of a single character sequence is not separated. For example, `000` should be encoded as `00 000` and not as `00 0 00 0 00 0` or `00 0 00 00` or `00 00 00 0`

In this stage, your program should:

1. Read a string from a console. The input contains a single line.
2. Print `The result:` line, followed by a line with an encoded message.
## Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input string:
> C

The result:
0 0 00 0000 0 00
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input string:
> CC

The result:
0 0 00 0000 0 000 00 0000 0 00
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input string:
> Hi <3

The result:
0 0 00 00 0 0 00 000 0 00 00 0 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0 00 000000 0 0000 00 000 0 00 00 00 0 00
```
