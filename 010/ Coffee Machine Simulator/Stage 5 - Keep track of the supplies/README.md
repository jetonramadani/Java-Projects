# Stage 5/6: Keep track of the supplies

## Description
Handling only a single action at a time is quite limited, so let's improve the program to handle multiple actions, one after another. The program should repeatedly ask a user what they want to do. If the user types `"buy"`, `"fill"` or `"take"`, then the program should behave exactly as it did in the previous stage. But unlike the previous stage, where the state of the coffee machine was displayed before and after each action (`"buy"`, `"fill"` or `"take"`), the state of the coffee machine should now be shown only when the user types `"remaining"`. Additionally, if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, they should type `"exit"` to stop the program. In total, the program should now five actions: `"buy"`, `"fill"`, `"take"`, `"remaining"`, and `"exit"`.

Remember, that:

- For a cup of **espresso**, the coffee machine needs 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffee beans. It costs $4.
- For a **latte**, the coffee machine needs 350 ml of water, 75 ml of milk, and 20 g of coffee beans. It costs $7.
- And for a **cappuccino**, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 100 ml of milk, and 12 g of coffee beans. It costs $6.

## Objectives
Write a program that continuously processes user actions until the `"exit"` command is given. Additionally, introduce two new options:

- `"remaining"`: to display the current state of the coffee machine
- `"exit"`: to switch off the coffee machine

Remember, the coffee machine can run out of resources. If it doesn't have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee and indicate which resource is missing.

And the last improvement to the program in this stage â€” if the user types `"buy"` to buy a cup of coffee but then changes their mind, they should be able to type `"back"` to return into the main menu.

> Note:
> 
>1. Your coffee machine should start with the same initial resources: 400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, 9 disposable cups, $550 in cash.
>2. The program should loop indefinitely, processing actions until the user types `"exit"` to switch off the coffee machine.

## Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
