# [Coffee Machine Simulator with Java](https://hyperskill.org/projects/33)

## About

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.

In this project, you'll program a coffee machine simulator using Java. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Java. Practice working with methods, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Here’s what awaits you:

### Stage 1/6: Make a first cup
Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!

### Stage 2/6: Calculate the ingredients
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

### Stage 3/6: Estimate the number of servings
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

### Stage 4/6: Add functions to your machine
Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

### Stage 5/6: Keep track of the supplies
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.

### Stage 6/6: Brush up your code
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
