# Stage 2/6: Calculate the ingredients

## Description
Now let's consider a scenario where you need a lot of coffee—perhaps you're hosting a party with many guests! In such cases, it's better to make preparations in advance.

In this stage, you will ask the user to enter the desired number of coffee cups. Based on this input, you will calculate the necessary amounts of water, coffee, and milk needed to prepare the specified quantity of coffee.

Please note that the coffee machine won't actually make any coffee in this stage; instead, it will simply compute the required ingredients.

## Objectives
Let's break down the task into several steps:

1. Read the number of coffee cups from the input.
2. Calculate the amount of each ingredient needed. One cup of coffee requires:
   - 200 ml of water
   - 50 ml of milk
   - 15 g of coffee beans

Output the required ingredient amounts back to the user.

> **Note:** As you work through each stage of the project, please ensure to remove any code from previous stages that is no longer needed. This includes printout messages from earlier steps, as they may not be relevant to the current implementation. Keeping your code clean and focused on the specific objectives of each stage will enhance clarity and improve the overall structure of your project.

## Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1**: a dialogue with a user might look like this
```text
Write how many cups of coffee you will need: 
> 25
For 25 cups of coffee you will need:
5000 ml of water
1250 ml of milk
375 g of coffee beans
```
**Example 2**: here is another dialogue
```text
Write how many cups of coffee you will need: 
> 125
For 125 cups of coffee you will need:
25000 ml of water
6250 ml of milk
1875 g of coffee beans
```
