# Stage 3/5: Working on the gameplay

## Description
An interesting idea has come to your mind. Let's change the rules of game. Players take turns taking `X` pencils until none of them remain.

## Objectives
Expand your program by creating a loop. Each player takes turns removing pencils until 0 pencils remain on the table. Each iteration prints 2 lines: lines with pencils (vertical bars) and whose turn is now by printing the `*NameX*'s turn` string. If there are no pencils left after a player's move, the loop breaks and the game ends without any additional output.

## Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**
```text
How many pencils would you like to use:
> 5
Who will be the first (John, Jack):
> John
|||||
John's turn:
> 2
|||
Jack's turn:
> 1
||
John's turn:
> 2
```
**Example 2:**
```text
How many pencils would you like to use:
> 15
Who will be the first (John, Jack):
> John
|||||||||||||||
John's turn:
> 8
|||||||
Jack's turn:
> 7
