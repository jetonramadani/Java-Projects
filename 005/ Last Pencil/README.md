## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:


### Stage 1/5: Empty the pencil case
It was a boring day, so your friend came up with the idea of creating a simple game.

### Stage 2/5: New rules
Let's change the game a little bit and add new conditions.

### Stage 3/5: Working on the gameplay
You've decided to try out new game mechanics and take turns until no pencils remain.

### Stage 4/5: Fair play
You took all the pencils in one turn. Your friend decided that it was unfair and somehow took a negative number of pencils! Who is the winner? Let's add the winning condition!

### Stage 5/5: The right strategy
You've played several games and found out that there's only one winning strategy. Your friend suggested implementing a bot to add a certain degree of randomness to the game.
