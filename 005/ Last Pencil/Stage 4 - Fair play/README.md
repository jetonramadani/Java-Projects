# Stage 4/5: Fair play

## Description
The game was interesting, but it went sour. No one was playing a fair game! You've taken 10 pencils, your friend decided that it is unfair and somehow took a negative number! Moreover, you both can't decide which of you won. Maybe, it's time to add new rules to the game.

## Objectives
In this stage, your task is to add a new level of control over the game. Check the input. If it's incorrect, print the reason why. Also, limit the possible amount of pencils taken. Let's say that players can remove not more than 3 pencils at a time.

Here are possible errors and their feedback:

1. The initial number of pencils is not a numeric string, so it can't be converted to an integer — `The number of pencils should be numeric`;

2. The initial number of pencils is equal to `0` — `The number of pencils should be positive`;

3. If the input is a negative amount, apply condition (1), as the minus sign is not a numeric;

4. If the chosen first player is not `*Name1*` or `*Name2*` — `Choose between *Name1* and *Name2*`;

5. One of the players has taken the number of pencils that differs from `1`, `2`, or `3` — `Possible values: '1', '2' or '3'`;

6. One of the players has taken more pencils than there are on the table — `Too many pencils were taken`.

If one of the errors occurs, ask for input once again. Please note that when an error occurs, you don't need to print whose turn it is. Just output the error feedback (see the examples below).

Don't forget to help determine the winner of the game. **The player who takes the last pencil loses the game**. Print out the result at the end of the game with the line `*Winner-name* won!`

Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

```

**Example 2**: the initial number of pencils equals 0
```text

```
**Example 3**: the chosen first player is not in the list
```text
