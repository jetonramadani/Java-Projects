# Stage 3/5: Endless game

## Description

We came up with a really cool idea in the previous stage. But the game is really short. Nobody plays a single shot of
rock paper scissors. We need to find a way to run the game forever. Not literally, though â€” let's implement a way to
stop your program.

Improve your program so that it will take an unlimited number of inputs until users enter `!exit`. After entering !exit,
the program should print `Bye!` and terminate. Also, let's try to handle invalid inputs: your program should be ready to
handle typos in user input, or when there's a mishmash instead of a normal command. So, if the input doesn't correspond
to any known command (an option or `!exit`), your program should output the following line: `Invalid input`.

## Objectives

Your program should:

- Take input from users;
- If the input contains `!exit`, output `Bye!` and stop the game;
- If the input is the name of the option, then pick a random option and output a line with the result of the game in the
  following format (`<option>` is the name of the option chosen by the program):
    - Loss: `Sorry, but the computer chose <option>`
    - Draw: `There is a draw (<option>)`
    - Win: `Well done. The computer chose <option> and failed`
- If the input corresponds to anything else, output `Invalid input`;
- Repeat it all over again.

## Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

**Example 1:**

```text
> rock
Well done. The computer chose scissors and failed
> paper
Well done. The computer chose rock and failed
> paper
There is a draw (paper)
> scissors
Sorry, but the computer chose rock
> rokc
Invalid input
> xit!
Invalid input
> !exit
Bye!
```
