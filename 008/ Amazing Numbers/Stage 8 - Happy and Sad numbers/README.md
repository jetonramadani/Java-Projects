# Stage 8/8 Happy and Sad numbers

## Description
In number theory, a **happy** number is a number that reaches 1 after a sequence during which the number is replaced by the sum of each digit squares. For example, 13 is a happy number, as 12 + 32 = 10 which leads to 12 + 02 = 1. On the other hand, 4 is not a happy number because the sequence starts with 42 = 16, 12 + 62 = 37, and finally reaches 22 + 02 = 4. This is the number that started the sequence, so the process goes on in an infinite cycle. A number that is not happy is called **Sad** (or **Unhappy**).

Our program is finished. It can indicate many interesting properties of numbers, it knows how to calculate them. Now, when prompted, a user can have a list of number properties. To complete the program, let's add an ability to exclude a property from the search query. If a user puts a **minus** (`-`) before the property, exclude this property from the search query. For example, if a user specifies `palindromic -duck`, it means that they are looking for Palindromic numbers that are not Ducks.

## Objectives
Your program should process the user requests. In this stage, your program should:

1. Welcome users;
2. Display the instructions;
3. Ask for a request;
4. If a user enters an empty request, print the instructions;
5. If the user enters zero, terminate the program;
6. If numbers are not natural, print the error message;
7. If an incorrect property is specified, print the error message and the list of available properties;
8. For one number, print the properties of the number;
9. For two numbers, print the properties of all numbers in the list;
10. For two numbers and two properties, print the list of numbers that contain the specified properties;
11. If a property is preceded by a minus, this property should not be present in a number;
12. If the user specifies mutually exclusive properties, abort the request and warn the user.
13. Once the request is processed, continue execution from step 3.

In this stage, property names include `even`, `odd`, `buzz`, `duck`, `palindromic`, `gapful`, `spy`, `sunny`, `square`, `jumping`, `sad`, and `happy`. Mutually exclusive properties are **even/odd**, **duck/spy**, **sunny/square**, **sad/happy** pairs, as well as direct opposites (`property` and `-property`). The test won't check the order of properties, their indentation, and spaces. You may format numbers as you like.

## Instructions

```text
Supported requests:
- enter a natural number to know its properties;
- enter two natural numbers to obtain the properties of the list:
  * the first parameter represents a starting number;
  * the second parameter shows how many consecutive numbers are to be printed;
- two natural numbers and properties to search for;
- a property preceded by minus must not be present in numbers;
- separate the parameters with one space;
- enter 0 to exit.
```

## Error messages
```text
The first parameter should be a natural number or zero.
```
```text
The second parameter should be a natural number.
```
```text
The property [SUN] is wrong.
Available properties:
[EVEN, ODD, BUZZ, DUCK, PALINDROMIC, GAPFUL, SPY, SQUARE, SUNNY, JUMPING, HAPPY, SAD]
```
```text
The properties [HOT, SUN] are wrong.
Available properties:
[EVEN, ODD, BUZZ, DUCK, PALINDROMIC, GAPFUL, SPY, SQUARE, SUNNY, JUMPING, HAPPY, SAD]
```
```text
The request contains mutually exclusive properties: [HAPPY, SAD]
There are no numbers with these properties.
```
```text
The request contains mutually exclusive properties: [-HAPPY, -SAD]
There are no numbers with these properties.
```
```text
The request contains mutually exclusive properties: [GAPFUL, -GAPFUL]
There are no numbers with these properties.
```
