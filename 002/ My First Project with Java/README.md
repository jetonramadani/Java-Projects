## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:

### Stage 1/3: Print the prices
  Start with printing the names of items and their prices using your first Java method.

### Stage 2/3: Measuring total income
  You know how much you earned by selling each item. Calculate the total earnings before staff and other expenses!

### Stage 3/3: Calculate net income
  Measure the shop's net income. Subtract staff, electricity, and security expenses.
