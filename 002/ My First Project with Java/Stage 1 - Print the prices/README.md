# Stage 1/3:Print the prices

## Theory
Welcome to your first Java **project**! On Hyperskill, a project is a practical task where you apply skills from theoretical topics. Each project is a complete application: a game, a search engine, etc. To help you grasp the idea, let's write a simple net income calculator in this one!

This is the first **stage** in the project, a step in its development. For example, you can't create a Tetris game in one take; instead, break down the task into smaller steps â€” designing a game board or a menu. Same with our projects, each consists of multiple stages.

Below, you will find a **description** that gives a context behind what you should do. **Objectives** state the main task of the stage and the details.

Write your code in the Code Editor below and press Run Solution to check it. If your solution is correct, move to the second stage by pressing Continue.


## Description
You've recently opened a new corner shop. It contains the following products: bubblegum, toffee, ice cream, milk chocolate, doughnuts, and pancakes. Your task is to write a program that displays the list of all products with their prices.

## Objectives

2. Print the item names and prices as shown in the example.
